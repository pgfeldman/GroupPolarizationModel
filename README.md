# GroupPolarizationModel
Java agent-based-simulation model to explore the effects of coordination in high-dimensional belief spaces

The project is self contained, and compiles with Java 8. All needed jar files are in the "lib" directory, and all sourcecode is in the "src" directory. This tool uses JavaFX, which as I understand it will not be supported in the future.

The main() for the interactive simulator is in src\com\philfeldman\GPGuis\GpGuiMainFlocking1.java

More documentation to come!
